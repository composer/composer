# Community

There are many people using Composer already, and quite a few of them are
contributing.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to Composer, please read the
[README](https://github.com/composer/composer) and
[CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com//composer/composer/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md)
documents.

The most important guidelines are described as follows:

> All code contributions - including those of people having commit access - must
> go through a pull request and approved by a core developer before being
> merged. This is to ensure proper review of all the code.
>
> Fork the project, create a feature branch, and send us a pull request.
>
> To ensure a consistent code base, you should make sure the code follows
> the [PSR-2 Coding Standards](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/).
