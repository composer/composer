### [2.0.0-alpha1] 2020-06-03

  * Breaking: This is a major release and while we tried to keep things compatible for most users, you might want to have a look at the [UPGRADE](UPGRADE-2.0.md) guides
  * Many CPU and memory performance improvements
  * The update command is now much more deterministic as it does not take the already installed packages into account
  * Package installation now performs all network operations first before doing any changes on disk, to reduce the chances of ending up with a partially updated vendor dir
  * Partial updates and require/remove are now much faster as they only load the metadata required for the updated packages
  * Added a [platform-check step](doc/07-runtime.md#platform-check) when vendor/autoload.php gets initialized which checks the current PHP version/extensions match what is expected and fails hard otherwise. Can be disabled with the platform-check config option
  * Added a [`Composer\InstalledVersions`](doc/07-runtime.md#installed-versions) class which is autoloaded in every project and lets you check which packages/versions are present at runtime
  * Added a `composer-runtime-api` virtual package which you can require (as e.g. `^2.0`) to ensure things like the InstalledVersions class above are present. It will effectively force people to use Composer 2.x to install your project
  * Added support for parallel downloads of package metadata and zip files, this requires that the curl extension is present and we thus strongly recommend enabling curl
  * Added much clearer dependency resolution error reporting for common error cases
  * Added support for updating to a specific version with partial updates, as well as a [--with flag](doc/03-cli.md#update--u) to pass in temporary constraint overrides
  * Added support for TTY mode on Linux/OSX/WSL so that script handlers now run in interactive mode

  * Added support for lib-zip platform package
  * Added `pre-operations-exec` event to be fired before the packages get installed/upgraded/removed
  * Added `pre-pool-create` event to be fired before the package pool for the dependency solver is created, which lets you modify the list of packages going in
  * Added `post-file-download` event to be fired after package dist files are downloaded, which lets you do additional checks on the files
  * Added --locked flag to `show` command to see the packages from the composer.lock file
  * Added --unused flag to `remove` command to make sure any packages which are not needed anymore get removed
  * Added --dry-run flag to `require` and `remove` commands
  * Added --no-install flag to `update`, `require` and `remove` commands to disable the install step and only do the update step (composer.lock file update)
  * Added --with-dependencies and --with-all-dependencies flag aliases to `require` and `remove` commands for consistency with `update`
  * Added more info to `vendor/composer/installed.json`, a dev key stores whether dev requirements were installed, and every package now has an install-path key with its install location
  * Added COMPOSER_DISABLE_NETWORK which if set makes Composer do its best to run offline. This can be useful when you have poor connectivity or to do benchmarking without network jitter
  * Added --json and --merge flags to `config` command to allow editing complex `extra.*` values by using json as input
  * Added confirmation prompt when running Composer as superuser in interactive mode
  * Added --no-check-version to `validate` command to remove the warning in case the version is defined
  * Added --ignore-platform-req (without s) to all commands supporting --ignore-platform-reqs, which accepts a package name so you can ignore only specific platform requirements
  * Added support for wildcards (`*`) in classmap autoloader paths
  * Added support for configuring GitLab deploy tokens in addition to private tokens, see [gitlab-token](doc/06-config.md#gitlab-token)
  * Added support for package version guessing for require and init command to take all platform packages into account, not just php version
  * Fixed package ordering when autoloading and especially when loading plugins, to make sure dependencies are loaded before their dependents
  * Fixed suggest output being very spammy, it now is only one line long and shows more rarely
  * Fixed conflict rules like e.g. >=5 from matching dev-master, as it is not normalized to 9999999-dev internally anymore
