--TEST--
Root alias changing after the lock file was created and invalidating it should show a decent error message
This also checks that an implicit stabilityFlag is added for the root package, if it is a dev version

Installing dependencies from lock file (including require-dev)
Verifying lock file contents can be installed on current platform.
Your lock file does not contain a compatible set of packages. Please run composer update.

  Problem 1
    - b/requirer is locked to version 1.0.0 and an update of this package was not requested.
    - b/requirer 1.0.0 requires root/pkg ^1 -> found root/pkg[2.x-dev] but it does not match the constraint. See https://getcomposer.org/dep-on-root for details and assistance.
