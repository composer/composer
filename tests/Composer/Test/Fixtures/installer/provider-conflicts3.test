Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires regular/pkg 1.* -> satisfiable by regular/pkg[1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3].
    - Root composer.json requires replacer/pkg 2.* -> satisfiable by replacer/pkg[2.0.0, 2.0.1, 2.0.2, 2.0.3].
    - Conclusion: don't install regular/pkg 1.0.3 (conflict analysis result)
    - Conclusion: don't install regular/pkg 1.0.2 (conflict analysis result)
    - Conclusion: don't install regular/pkg 1.0.1 (conflict analysis result)
    - Only one of these can be installed: regular/pkg[1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.0.2, 1.0.3], replacer/pkg[2.0.0, 2.0.1, 2.0.2, 2.0.3]. replacer/pkg replaces regular/pkg and thus cannot coexist with it.
