Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - __root__ is present at version 1.0.0+no-version-set and cannot be modified by Composer
    - Root composer.json requires some/dep dev-main -> satisfiable by some/dep[dev-main].
    - __root__ 1.0.0+no-version-set conflicts with some/dep 1.3.x-dev.
    - some/dep 1.3.x-dev is an alias of some/dep dev-main and must be installed with it.
