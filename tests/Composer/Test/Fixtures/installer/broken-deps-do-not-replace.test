  Problem 1
    - c/c 1.0.0 requires x/x 1.0 -> no matching package found.
    - b/b 1.0.0 requires c/c 1.* -> satisfiable by c/c[1.0.0].
    - Installation request for b/b 1.* -> satisfiable by b/b[1.0.0].

Potential causes:
 - A typo in the package name
 - The package is not available in a stable-enough version according to your minimum-stability setting
