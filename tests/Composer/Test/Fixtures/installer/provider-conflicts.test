Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - __root__ is present at version 1.2.3 and cannot be modified by Composer
    - Root composer.json requires provider/pkg * -> satisfiable by provider/pkg[1.0.0].
    - provider/pkg[1.0.0] cannot be installed as that would require removing __root__[1.2.3]. They both replace root-replaced/transitive-replaced and thus cannot coexist.
