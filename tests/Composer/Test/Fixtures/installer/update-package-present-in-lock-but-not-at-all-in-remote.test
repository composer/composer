Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires main/dep * -> satisfiable by main/dep[1.0.0].
    - main/dep 1.0.0 requires locked/dep ^2.1 -> found locked/dep[2.1.0] in the lock file but not in remote repositories, make sure you avoid updating this package to keep the one from the lock file.
