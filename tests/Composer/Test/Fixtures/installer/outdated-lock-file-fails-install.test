--EXPECT-OUTPUT--
Installing dependencies from lock file (including require-dev)
Verifying lock file contents can be installed on current platform.
<warning>Warning: The lock file is not up to date with the latest changes in composer.json. You may be getting outdated dependencies. It is recommended that you run `composer update` or `composer update <package name>`.</warning>
- Required package "some/dep" is in the lock file as "dev-foo" but that does not satisfy your constraint "dev-main".
- Required package "some/dep2" is not present in the lock file.
This usually happens when composer files are incorrectly merged or the composer.json file is manually edited.
Read more about correctly resolving merge conflicts https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/resolving-merge-conflicts.md
and prefer using the "require" command over editing the composer.json file directly https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md#require-r
