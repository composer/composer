--EXPECT-OUTPUT--
Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires foo/pkg ^1.0 -> satisfiable by foo/pkg[1.0.0].
    - foo/pkg 1.0.0 requires some/dep ^1 -> found some/dep[dev-main] but it does not match the constraint.

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.
