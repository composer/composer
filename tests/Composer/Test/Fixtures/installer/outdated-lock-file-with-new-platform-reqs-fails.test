--TEST--
Test that install checks platform requirements from both composer.json AND composer.lock even if the lock file is outdated.
Platform requires appearing in both lock and composer.json will be checked using the composer.json as source of truth (see ext-foo).

--EXPECT-OUTPUT--
Installing dependencies from lock file (including require-dev)
Verifying lock file contents can be installed on current platform.
<warning>Warning: The lock file is not up to date with the latest changes in composer.json. You may be getting outdated dependencies. It is recommended that you run `composer update` or `composer update <package name>`.</warning>
Your lock file does not contain a compatible set of packages. Please run composer update.

  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires php-64bit ^25 but your php-64bit version (%s) does not satisfy that requirement.
  Problem 2
    - Root composer.json requires PHP extension ext-foo ^10 but it is missing from your system. Install or enable PHP's foo extension.
  Problem 3
    - Root composer.json requires php ^20 but your php version (%s) does not satisfy that requirement.

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
__inilist__
You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-foo` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.
