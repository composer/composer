Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires acme/library 1.0.0 -> satisfiable by acme/library[1.0.0].
    - acme/library 1.0.0 requires acme/library-dependency ^1.0 -> found acme/library-dependency[1.0.0] but these were not loaded, because they have security advisories.
