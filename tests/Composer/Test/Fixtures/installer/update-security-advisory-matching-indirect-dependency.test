Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires acme/library 1.0.0 -> satisfiable by acme/library[1.0.0].
    - acme/library 1.0.0 requires acme/library-dependency ^1.0 -> found acme/library-dependency[1.0.0] but these were not loaded, because they are affected by security advisories ("PKSA-1234-abcd-1234"). Go to https://packagist.org/security-advisories/ to find advisory details. To ignore the advisories, add them to the audit "ignore" config. To turn the feature off entirely, you can set "block-insecure" to false in your "audit" config.
