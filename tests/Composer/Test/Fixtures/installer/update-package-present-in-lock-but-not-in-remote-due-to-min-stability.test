Update package which is in lock file but not remote repo due to min-stability should show this error correctly

Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires main/dep * -> satisfiable by main/dep[1.0.0].
    - main/dep 1.0.0 requires locked/dep ^2.1 -> found locked/dep[2.x-dev] but it does not match your minimum-stability and is therefore not installable. Make sure you either fix the minimum-stability or avoid updating this package to keep the one present in the lock file (locked/dep[2.1.0]).
