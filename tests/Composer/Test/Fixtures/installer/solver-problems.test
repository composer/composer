--EXPECT-OUTPUT--
Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies (including require-dev)
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - The requested package unstable/package 2.* exists as unstable/package[1.0.0] but these are rejected by your constraint.
  Problem 2
    - The requested package bogus could not be found in any version, there may be a typo in the package name.
  Problem 3
    - The requested package stable-requiree-excluded (installed at 1.0.0, required as 1.0.1) is satisfiable by stable-requiree-excluded[1.0.0] but these conflict with your requirements or minimum-stability.
  Problem 4
    - Installation request for requirer 1.* -> satisfiable by requirer[1.0.0].
    - requirer 1.0.0 requires dependency 1.0.0 -> satisfiable by dependency[1.0.0] but these conflict with your requirements or minimum-stability.

Potential causes:
 - A typo in the package name
 - The package is not available in a stable-enough version according to your minimum-stability setting
   see <https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#minimum-stability> for more details.
 - It's a private package and you forgot to add a custom repository to find it

Read <https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md> for further common problems.
