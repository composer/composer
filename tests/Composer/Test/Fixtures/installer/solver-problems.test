Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires missing/provided-api 2.*, it could not be found in any version, but the following packages provide it:
      - api/provider Provides the missing API
      Consider requiring one of these to satisfy the missing/provided-api requirement.
  Problem 2
    - Root composer.json requires unstable/package 2.*, found unstable/package[2.0.0-alpha] but it does not match your minimum-stability.
  Problem 3
    - Root composer.json requires non-existent/pkg, it could not be found in any version, there may be a typo in the package name.
  Problem 4
    - Root composer.json requires stable-requiree-excluded/pkg 1.0.1 (exact version match: 1.0.1 or 1.0.1.0), found stable-requiree-excluded/pkg[1.0.1] but the package is fixed to 1.0.0 (lock file version) by a partial update and that version does not match. Make sure you list it as an argument for the update command.
  Problem 5
    - Root composer.json requires linked library lib-xml 1002.* but it has the wrong version installed or is missing from your system, make sure to load the extension providing it.
  Problem 6
    - Root composer.json requires linked library lib-icu 1001.* but it has the wrong version installed, try upgrading the intl extension.
  Problem 7
    - Root composer.json requires PHP extension ext-xml 1002.* but it has the wrong version installed (%s).
  Problem 8
    - Root composer.json requires php 1 (exact version match: 1, 1.0, 1.0.0 or 1.0.0.0) but your php version (%s) does not satisfy that requirement.
  Problem 9
    - Root composer.json requires package/found 2.* -> satisfiable by package/found[2.0.0].
    - package/found 2.0.0 requires unstable/package2 2.* -> found unstable/package2[2.0.0-alpha] but it does not match your minimum-stability.
  Problem 10
    - Root composer.json requires package/found3 2.* -> satisfiable by package/found3[2.0.0].
    - package/found3 2.0.0 requires unstable/package2 2.* -> found unstable/package2[2.0.0-alpha] but it does not match your minimum-stability.
  Problem 11
    - Root composer.json requires package/found4 2.* -> satisfiable by package/found4[2.0.0].
    - package/found4 2.0.0 requires non-existent/pkg2 1.* -> could not be found in any version, there may be a typo in the package name.
  Problem 12
    - Root composer.json requires package/found6 2.* -> satisfiable by package/found6[2.0.0].
    - package/found6 2.0.0 requires stable-requiree-excluded/pkg2 1.0.1 -> found stable-requiree-excluded/pkg2[1.0.0] but it does not match the constraint.
  Problem 13
    - Root composer.json requires package/found7 2.* -> satisfiable by package/found7[2.0.0].
    - package/found7 2.0.0 requires php-64bit 1.0.1 -> your php-64bit version (%s) does not satisfy that requirement.
  Problem 14
    - Root composer.json requires requirer/pkg 1.* -> satisfiable by requirer/pkg[1.0.0].
    - requirer/pkg 1.0.0 requires dependency/pkg 1.0.0 -> found dependency/pkg[1.0.0] but it conflicts with your root composer.json require (2.*).
  Problem 15
    - Root composer.json requires package/found5 2.* -> satisfiable by package/found5[2.0.0].
    - package/found5 2.0.0 requires requirer/pkg 1.* -> satisfiable by requirer/pkg[1.0.0].
    - requirer/pkg 1.0.0 requires dependency/pkg 1.0.0 -> found dependency/pkg[1.0.0] but it conflicts with your root composer.json require (2.*).

Potential causes:
 - A typo in the package name
 - The package is not available in a stable-enough version according to your minimum-stability setting
   see <https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#minimum-stability> for more details.
 - It's a private package and you forgot to add a custom repository to find it

Read <https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md> for further common problems.

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
__inilist__
You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-xml` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.

Use the option --with-all-dependencies (-W) to allow upgrades, downgrades and removals for packages currently locked to specific versions.
