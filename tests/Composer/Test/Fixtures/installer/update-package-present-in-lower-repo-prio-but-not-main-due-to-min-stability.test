Update package which is in lower prio repo but not main repo due to min-stability should show this error correctly

Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires main/dep * -> satisfiable by main/dep[1.0.0].
    - main/dep 1.0.0 requires lower/dep ^2.1 -> satisfiable by lower/dep[2.1.0] from package repo (defining 1 package) but lower/dep[2.x-dev] from package repo (defining 3 packages) has higher repository priority. The packages from the higher priority repository do not match your minimum-stability and are therefore not installable. That repository is canonical so the lower priority repo's packages are not installable. See https://getcomposer.org/repoprio for details and assistance.
