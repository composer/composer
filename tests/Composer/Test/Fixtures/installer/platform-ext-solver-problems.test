Loading composer repositories with package information
Updating dependencies
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - Root composer.json requires a/a * -> satisfiable by a/a[1.0.0].
    - a/a 1.0.0 requires ext-filter 2.0.0 -> it has the wrong version installed (7.4.0; overridden via config.platform, actual: %s).

To enable extensions, verify that they are enabled in your .ini files:
__inilist__
You can also run `php --ini` in a terminal to see which files are used by PHP in CLI mode.
Alternatively, you can run Composer with `--ignore-platform-req=ext-filter` to temporarily ignore these required extensions.
