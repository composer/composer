--TEST--
Checks that package versions in InstalledVersions are correct during an upgrade. Noteworthy things:

  - PluginA sees the old version of PluginB until that upgrade happened
  - PluginA/PluginB see an old version of themselves. This is a quirk which we are unlikely to fix
  - Local dependencies (symfony/*) always show the Composer-bundled version

update plugin/* symfony/console symfony/filesystem symfony/process
