--TEST--
Checks that package versions in InstalledVersions are correct on initial install. Noteworthy things:

  - PluginA is not yet found at the moment where it is first initialized. This is a quirk which we are unlikely to fix
  - PluginB is not yet found at the moment where it is first initialized, but it finds PluginA which was installed before
  - Local dependencies (symfony/*) always show the Composer-bundled version
